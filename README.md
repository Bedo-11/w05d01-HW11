# Ruby On Rails Homework

## Read Ruby on Rails Guide to answer the questions below:
**[Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)**
- Apply your knowledge of Ruby on rails to answer these questions.

## Questions
1. What is Active Record? 
- Converting data that is in rows/columns/tables into JSON
2. What is MVC?
- It's architecture pattern. this pattern involves making three core types of components, each responsible for a different part of the server's functionality.

A ##Model directly manages the data in our application, and provides a representation of that data for the rest of the application to use.

A ##View is like it sounds - it's data that gets sent back to the client for the user to consume.

A ##Controller responds to user requests as they come in, and utilizes both the model and the view components to perform the desired behavior and produce a response.

3. What is REST-ful routing?
- A RESTful route is a route that provides mapping between HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful route also depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.

4. What are migration files and why do we need them?
- Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner. 
- You could edit fragments of SQL by hand but you would then be responsible for telling other developers that they need to go and run them. Youâ€™d also have to keep track of which changes need to be run against the production machines next time you deploy.

5. What does the `rails routes` do?
- indicate to the server which controllers should be triggered (and how) by which kinds of requests.

6. Walk us through the setup and code for building a new rails app in Rails.
